## 12/26/2025 4 PM - A challenge for myself  

_Time spent: 0.1h_  

### With this project i am taking a challenge to make schematics and route a pcb within next 24hr.
### from this i can evaluate my skills and technical ability.

### in my benefit i already knew how stm and mcu works

PS: WISH ME LUCK

## 12/26/2025 10 PM - MAJOR UPDATE  

_Time spent: 6.5h_  

### Finished making schematics YES I have finished making schematic's now i have exported this project to kicad because i feel comfortable in KiCad to route the pcb.

## 12/27/2025 4 PM - Spooky FC PCB Routed & Silkscreen Completed 🎃  

_Time spent: 12.0h_  

**Finally,**
I’ve successfully completed the routing of Spooky FC and carefully checked the PCB’s integrity to make sure there are no shorts, missing connections, or critical design issues. Routing under a strict time limit was challenging, but it really pushed me to stay focused and efficient.

Along with routing, I also finished designing the silkscreen layer. All component names, orientations, and important markings are now clearly placed, making Spooky FC much easier to assemble, debug, and test later on. Clean and readable silkscreen is something I didn’t want to compromise on, even within this tight timeline.

With routing, integrity checks, and silkscreen design completed, Spooky FC is now fabrication-ready. Making this much progress within 24 hours feels incredibly rewarding and keeps the momentum strong for the next steps.
